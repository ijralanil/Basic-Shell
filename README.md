# Basic-Shell
This is a basic implementation of shell. This shell works in two mode, single shot (with -c option) in which it executes command and exits. the second mode is Continuous mode, in this mode it waits for input and executes commands as soon as it gets it. Some basic features as multi-level Pipe(|), Indirection(>) and command separator(;) are implemented.
